How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Just make one logical change in the code,
 add the changed files to the staging area and finally if the changes are bad then checkout to the previous commit or otherwise commit the changes.
It gives the flexibility to split the task into smaller tasks and commit smaller changes.
